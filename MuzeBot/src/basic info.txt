OK, The sheet music class is coming along. At the moment it only displays properly when its origin is 0,0.. i'll fix that later I'm getting tired for now..

The entire component should be scalable but I haven't had time to play around with it and check it yet.

The implementation is fairly simple you just add it to your frame after you initialize it the way you do everything else, i.e. --  
SheetMusicComponent smc = new SheetMusicC....; blah blah
add(SheetMusicComponent);

a sheet music component must be initialized with a SheetMusic object.

I have it all set up to be working but I still need to get the font thing going so for now I'm just using normal strings to be replaced with the font once that's working.


I included an example implementation of how it works.

Cheers!!
